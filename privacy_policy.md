Last modified: August 21, 2017

This Privacy Policy illustrates what personal information you may share with us, Jens Stroh ("we", or "our") when installing and using the RecipeBook and RecipeBookLite app (each, the "Application"). It also describes how we receive, collect, process and use such information. We will diligently respect your fundamental legal rights to data protection and privacy.


ATTENTION: PLEASE READ OUR PRIVACY POLICY CAREFULLY BEFORE DOWNLOADING THE APPLICATION. DOWNLOADING OR USING THE APPLICATION INDICATES THAT YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THIS PRIVACY POLICY IN FULL. IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THIS PRIVACY POLICY, DO NOT DOWNLOAD OR USE THE APPLICATION.


### COLLECTION AND USE

All data entered into the Application by you remains on your device, unless you choose to back it up to Dropbox. We never pass this data on or use it in any way other than to present it to you via the app interface.

Occasionally we may require you to enter a user name and password in order to connect to a third party service. We do not store these user names and passwords, and we never pass these on to any other companies or services.

If you contact us by email, then we will retain a copy of your email address solely for the purpose of contacting you again in the future. This will usually be in response to a communication from you, but we may from time to time inform you of similar products of ours which we feel may be of interest.

We may use a third party analytics service to help anonymously monitor app usage and identify potential issues, so we can deliver a better user experience and improve the Application. Device and usage information collected may include (i) information specific to your mobile device (e.g., make, model, operating system, advertising identifier and similar information); (ii) information about your use of features, functions, or notifications on the device; and (iii) signal strength relating to WiFi or Bluetooth functionality, temperature, battery level, and similar technical data. We may collect this information even if you are not logged in to the Application.


### DROPBOX BACKUPS (not supported in RecipeBookLite)


You can backup your recipes on your personal account on the Dropbox servers, or import data from your Dropbox account. At this point the data will be covered by Dropbox's privacy policy: https://www.dropbox.com/privacy.


### SHARING YOUR INFORMATION

We will share your information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this Privacy Policy. We may disclose your information if:

- As required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena or similar legal process.

- When we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud or respond to a government request.

CAMERA: This permission allows the Application to capture the user's images in order for them to be assigned to a recipe.

STORAGE: This permission allows the Application to store backup data locally.

NETWORK COMMUNICATION: This permission is needed in order to backup the Application data to your Dropbox account, or import data from Dropbox.
